        This page outlines some of the various car/jetski projects I have done. 
        <br><br>
        My primary project car is a 1997 Miata. I am fortunate to be the third owner of this M edition.
        Upon purchasing, I performed general maintenance tasks such as new filters (air/fuel), fluid changes (oil/coolant/trans/diff), hose replacements (coolant/vacuum/fuel), 
        radiator/thermostat, spark plugs, timing belt, water pump, front main seal, cranksaft seals, and valve cover gasket to name a few. 
        <br><br>
        I then proceeded to perform modifications, starting with a stronger clutch kit and lighter flywheel.
        This was done as the throwout bearing was beginning to make some noise, and I wanted to future proof it for a turbo setup. 
        Unfortunately, by the time I got to installing a turbo system a few years had past and I already needed another clutch. 
        <br><br>
        The turbo system was pieced together slowly over time. The first purchase was the turbo, a Garrett SR20DET. 
        After spending hours hammering and torching it apart, a rebuild kit was installed to get it back to original condition. 
        The next purchase was the ECU, a kit from DIY Autotune. This required soldering an auxillary board to interface with the Miata sensors which connected to
         the main microcontroller for real-time processing. 
        A custom harness was also fabricated to plug into the Miata harness. 
        <br><br>
        From this point, it was mostly running oil/water lines, routing intercooler piping, higher flow rate injectors, adding gauges (boost/AFR), temp sensors, MAP sensors, 
        boost controller, and finally, I taught myself welding and fabricated a custom downpipe and exhaust. Although the welds looked terrible, they didn't leak and did the job.
        <br><br>
        This setup has been running reliably on a street tune and 12 pounds of boost for the past three years now. 
        I have a 2002 engine with variable valve timing that I am in the process of rebuilding for higher compression and boost.

      My other project car is a 1989 Nissan hardbody 4x4 V6, but have focused my priorities elsewhere for now. 
      <br><br>
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Jetskis</h3>
      After moving closer to a lake, I decided to purchase some jetski's and now own four 90s model Seadoo's, three of which have the 787 Rotax engine.
      The one I use most frequently is a 97 SPX, and is the one I have worked on the most.       
      There is a lot of additional information I will share about these projects, but for now, the below images highlight some of the work I have done, essentially rebuilding everything.
